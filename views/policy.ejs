                        <p class="policy-text">We are highly qualified teachers, experienced with students of all ages. We understand that art has connections with all disciplines. We have developed a summer mini camp curriculum for<b> K-6 Graders!</b> Our Math Art Connections (<b>MAC</b>) camps help campers connect math skills to fun arts, crafts, and game activities to maximize the creativity and enjoyment of learning.  Each camp is currently <b>limited to 6 participants</b>. We believe that keeping the<b> 3:1 student to teacher ratio</b> low, maximizes the opportunities for your child’s success. We want to work with parents and families to make this summer camp experience the best possible.</p>
